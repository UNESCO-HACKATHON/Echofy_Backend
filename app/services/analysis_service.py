    Performs the actual content analysis.

    This is a placeholder function. In a real application, this is where you would:
    1. Preprocess the text.
    2. Make a request to your Hugging Face model endpoint.
    3. Process the model's response.
    4. (Later) Integrate a more complex LangChain chain.

    For now, it uses simple keyword-based logic to simulate an analysis.

    Args:
        content: The text content to analyze.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the analysis results, matching the AnalysisResponse model.
